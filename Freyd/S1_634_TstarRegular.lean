  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* — §1.634 / §1.635 (stalk FAMILY).

  **The product stalk functor `T⋆ : 𝒞 → Set^I` is a representation of REGULAR categories.**

  `S1_62` builds the ultra-filter stalk family `Tstar A = (F̂ ↦ T_F̂ A)` into the power
  `(StalkIndex 𝒞 → Type u)`, and `StalkRegular` proves that for EACH ultra-filter `F̂` the fibre
  functor `T_F̂ = TF F̂.val` is a `RegularFunctor` (`TF_regularFunctor`).  Here we package the FAMILY:
  since `Tstar` is, at every fibre `F̂`, exactly the functor `TF F̂.val`, and limits / images / monos
  / covers in the power `Set^I` are computed FIBREWISE, each of the five `RegularFunctor` fields for
  `Tstar` reduces — definitionally at each fibre — to the corresponding per-fibre `TF_*` lemma.

  Cover- and image-preservation need the elements of each ultra-filter to be PROJECTIVE; in a CAPITAL
  positive pre-logos that is §1.633 (`capital_filter_projective`), so the only hypothesis is
  `Capital`.  The members of an ultra-filter are complemented subterminators (the 2nd component of
  `IsUltraFilter`), and §1.633 turns that into projectivity.

/-! ## Fibrewise bridges for the power category `Set^I = (I → Type w)`

  Three elementary facts: an iso / image / pullback in the power is exactly a fibrewise iso / image /
  pullback.  (Monos and covers already have `power_monic_iff` / `power_cover_iff` in `S1_62`.)  These
  let us reduce each `Preserves*` for `Tstar` to the per-fibre `TF_*` lemma. -/
