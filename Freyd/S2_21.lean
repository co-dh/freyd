  Freyd & Scedrov, *Categories and Allegories* — §2.218.

  "A small pre-tabular or semi-simple unitary distributive allegory may be faithfully
  represented in a power of the allegory of sets."

  This file ASSEMBLES the §2.218 representation from the bricks built elsewhere:
    • BRICK 1  `Freyd.SetRegular.{setRegular,powerRegular}`   (S1_62)   — `Set`, `Set^I` regular.
    • BRICK 2  `Freyd.RelFunctor.RegularFunctor` + `relAllegoryHom`     (RelCat) — `Rel(F)`.
    • BRICK 2c `Freyd.homRep_regularFunctor`                            (RelCat) — `homRep` regular.
    • BRICK 3  `Freyd.PowerAllegory.powerAllegory`                      (RelCat) — `𝒜^I` allegory.
    • R1       `RegularFunctor.relAllegoryHom_faithful_of_reflects`     (RelCat) — Rel(F) faithful
               for a NON-FULL `F` (reflects isos + split covers) — the §2.218 wall, now CLOSED.

  The genuine residuals isolated as explicit hypotheses are documented at `repr_in_power_of_sets`.

/-! ## §2.218  `Rel(homRep 𝒞)` is faithful for a capital regular category

  For a regular category `𝒞` in which every cover splits (`hproj` — the §1.543 capital
  situation) and which has *images* (`RegularCategory`), the Henkin–Lubkin representation
  `homRep 𝒞 : 𝒞 → Set^|𝒞|` is a `RegularFunctor` (BRICK 2c) that reflects isos
  (`homRep_reflects_iso`); covers in `Set^|𝒞|` split (fibrewise surjections, `power_cover_iff`).
  So the §2.218 (2b′) non-full faithfulness `relAllegoryHom_faithful_of_reflects` (R1) applies. -/

/-- Every cover in the power category `𝒞 → Type u` splits: a cover is fibrewise surjective
    (`power_cover_iff`), and each fibre surjection has a section (choice). -/

    Combines BRICK 2c (`homRep_regularFunctor`), `homRep_reflects_iso`, and the §2.218 (2b′)
    image-reflection faithfulness (R1). -/

/-! ## §2.218  The faithful representation in a power of the allegory of sets

  `RelObj (𝒞 → Type u)` is the allegory of (jointly-monic) relations in `Set^|𝒞|`.  Up to the
  fibrewise comparison `RelObj(Set^I) ≅ (RelObj Set)^I` (BRICK 3 `powerAllegory`, the
  un-built routine half), it is a *power of the allegory of sets*; the §2.218 headline names the
  target as exactly this allegory of relations in `Set^I`. -/

/-- **§2.218 (assembly).**  Let `𝒜` be a (small) unitary distributive allegory which is tabular
    — the hypothesis discharged from *pre-tabular*/*semi-simple* by §2.16(10)/§2.167 (Spl).  Given:
      • `bridge`  — a FAITHFUL allegory morphism `𝒜 ⟶ Rel(Map 𝒜)` presenting `𝒜` as relations in
        the regular category `Map 𝒜` (R2: the §2.148 carrier equivalence in span form);
      • `Ā`, regular (`RegularCategory Ā`) and capital (`hproj`: every cover in `Ā` splits), with a
        FAITHFUL regular allegory morphism `cap : Rel(Map 𝒜) ⟶ Rel(Ā)` from capitalizing
        `Map 𝒜 ↪ Ā` (R3: §1.543 — `capitalization_of_capData`, supplying regularity + projectivity
        of the capital colimit) —
    THEN `𝒜` is FAITHFULLY represented in `Rel(Set^|Ā|)`, the allegory of relations in a power of
    sets, via `bridge ⋙ cap ⋙ Rel(homRep Ā)`.

    The composite is an `AllegoryFunctor` (`AllegoryFunctor.comp`); its faithfulness is the
    composite of the three faithfulnesses (`AllegoryFunctor.Faithful.comp`), the last of which is
    the §2.218 wall `relHomRep_faithful` (R1 + BRICK 2c).  ALL bricks are built; the two `bridge`/
    `cap`+`Ā` hypotheses are the precisely-isolated residuals (R2 / R3). -/

/-! ## §2.218 (K2) — the ULTRA-FILTER STALK route to a faithful `Rel(𝒞) → Rel(Set)`

  Freyd's §1.635 proves the representation theorem through the stalk functors `T_F̂` rather than the
  raw hom-representation.  The keystone `TF_regularFunctor` (K1, `Freyd/StalkRegular.lean`) makes a
  single stalk a `RegularFunctor 𝒞 → Set`, so `Rel(T_F̂)` is an allegory morphism `Rel(𝒞) → Rel(Set)`.
  Its FAITHFULNESS, via `relAllegoryHom_faithful_of_reflects`, needs exactly two facts about the
  stalk — and the stalk route does NOT remove either of the §2.218 residuals, it RELOCATES them:

    (R3, projectivity)  `T_F̂` preserves COVERS only when the elements of `F̂` are PROJECTIVE
        (`TF_preserves_covers_of_projective`).  This is Freyd's own hypothesis — his §1.635 proof
        opens *"We may concentrate on a CAPITAL positive pre-logos A [1.63]"* precisely so that the
        complemented subterminators (the ultra-filter's members) are projective (§1.633).  So
        capitalization is STILL required; the colimit does not buy cover-preservation for free
        (covers are not a finite-limit notion — only `pres_prod`/`pres_pullback`/`pres_mono` are
        unconditional).

    (CONSERVATIVITY)  `relAllegoryHom_faithful_of_reflects` needs `T_F̂` to REFLECT ISOS.  A single
        stalk does not; this is the §2.217-grade joint conservativity of the stalk FAMILY, the
        genuinely irreducible residual (`StalkResidual.reflect` in `S1_62`).

  Covers in `Set` split (choice, `set_cover_splits`), so the third ingredient is free. -/

/-- **§2.218 (K2, single stalk).**  For a positive pre-logos `𝒞` and an ultra-filter `F̂` whose
    members are PROJECTIVE (the capital case, §1.633) and whose stalk `T_F̂` REFLECTS ISOS
    (conservativity), `Rel(T_F̂) : Rel(𝒞) ⟶ Rel(Set)` is a FAITHFUL allegory morphism.

    This is the stalk-route analogue of `relHomRep_faithful`; it shows the stalk does not bypass
    either §2.218 residual (projectivity + conservativity) but packages them cleanly via K1. -/

/-! ## §1.633 discharges the stalk-route PROJECTIVITY residual (R3) in the capital case

  Freyd's §1.635 stalk construction takes `ℱ` to be an ultra-filter on the boolean algebra `ℬ`
  of COMPLEMENTED SUBTERMINATORS of a CAPITAL positive pre-logos.  For such an `ℱ` the
  `hproj` hypothesis of `TF_regularFunctor`/`relStalk_faithful` (each member projective) is no
  longer an assumption: it is `capital_complementedSub_projective` (§1.633).  This is exactly why
  Freyd opens §1.635 with *"we may concentrate on a capital positive pre-logos"*. -/

/-- **§1.633 ⟹ stalk projectivity.**  In a CAPITAL positive pre-logos, if every member of the
    pre-filter `ℱ` is a complemented subterminator, then every member's domain is projective —
    discharging the `hproj` residual of the stalk route. -/
