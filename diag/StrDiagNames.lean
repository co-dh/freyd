  The PICTURE's own spelling of the relators a string-diagram lane can be.  A lane's label decides
  the panel's geometry — `columns` reserves room west of a lane for its own name — so a wire the
  note writes `F` cannot print as `BiRelator.toRelator F` and still land where the note draws it.

  Printing only: every declaration here is an unexpander, nothing is proved and nothing is used.
  They live in `diag` rather than beside their declarations because they are the DIAGRAM's
  vocabulary, not the algebra's — `T` is what the note calls the type functor's relator, and the
  `AOP` module already spells the same functor's action on arrows `T(R)`.
